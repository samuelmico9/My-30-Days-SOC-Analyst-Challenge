# **Day#24- Introduction to Malware Analysis**

---

## üéØ **Lab Objective**

This lab introduces my team to the basics of malware analysis. You‚Äôll learn how to identify malicious files, analyze them statically using free tools, and extract indicators like file names, hashes, strings, and behavior ‚Äî all without needing to run the malware.

## üß† **What is Malware Analysis?**

**Malware Analysis** is the process of examining malicious software to understand its origin, behavior, impact, and indicators. It helps SOC analysts detect infections, contain threats, and prevent future compromises.

### üîç Types of Malware Analysis:
- **Static Analysis:** Examining a file without executing it
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Observing file behavior during execution (sandboxing)
- **Memory Analysis:** Investigating malware artifacts in memory
- **Reverse Engineering:** Deconstructing the code (advanced)

---

‚úÖ Key Objectives:
- Identify the type of malware (e.g., trojan, ransomware, info-stealer)
- Determine how it spreads (email, USB, download, vulnerability)
- Understand its behavior (file modifications, network connections, persistence)
- Extract IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) (hashes, domains, IPs, registry keys)
- Help in detection and prevention (create YARA rules, update AV signatures, SIEM rules)
- Support incident response (understand timeline, impact, and cleanup strategy)

| üîê Detect Obfuscation or Packing     | Identify if the file is packed to hide malicious code            | PEiD, Detect It Easy (DIE), PEStudio                            |
| üåê Scan Embedded Domains or URLs     | Uncover external connections or phishing links                   | VirusTotal, CyberChef, URLScan.io                              |
| üîÅ Analyze Imports/Functions         | Understand what Windows APIs or system calls the file uses       | PEStudio, CFF Explorer, IDA Free, Ghidra                        |
| üß¨ Compare to Known Malware Samples  | Check similarity to known malware families or signatures         | Intezer Analyze, Hybrid Analysis, VirusTotal Behavior           |
| üì¶ Hex & Binary Inspection           | Manually examine binary structure for hidden artifacts           | HxD, Hexed.it, 010 Editor                                       |


## üß™ **Lab Tasks ‚Äì Perform Static Malware Analysis**


## üõ†Ô∏è **Lab Setup**

You will perform basic static malware analysis using a publicly known test malware file.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **We will use a safe EICAR test file** ‚Äì not harmful, but detected by AV tools.

### üîß Tools You‚Äôll Use:
- [EICAR Test Malware Sample FIle](https://www.eicar.org/download/eicar-com-2/?wpdmdl=8842&refresh=67f24bb33b5f41743932339)
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com)
- [Hybrid Analysis](https://www.hybrid-analysis.com/)
- [Any.Run (Optional)](https://any.run)
- [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef)
- [Intezer Analyze (Optional)](https://analyze.intezer.com/)
- Strings or Hex Viewer (e.g., [https://hexed.it](https://hexed.it))
