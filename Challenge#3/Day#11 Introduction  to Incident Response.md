# **Day#11: Introduction to Incident Response**

## **Objective:**
The objective of this lab is to introduce my team to the **core concepts of incident response**, familiarize them with the **incident response lifecycle**, and help them understand how basic threats on Windows systems are detected, analyzed, and responded to by SOC Analysts.

## **What is Incident Response?**

**Incident Response (IR)** is the structured approach to handle and manage the aftermath of a **security breach or cyberattack**, also known as an incident. It includes steps to:
- Detect the incident
- Contain the damage
- Investigate the root cause
- Recover normal operations
- Report and document findings

## **Incident Response Process (NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2)**

The NIST Incident Response Lifecycle includes **4 main phases**:

| **Phase**                         | **Description**                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Preparation**               | Establish policies, train team, and set up tools and logging mechanisms.       |
| **2. Detection and Analysis**    | Identify potential incidents using logs, alerts, and anomaly detection systems.|
| **3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery** | Isolate threats, remove malware/artifacts, and restore systems securely.       |
| **4. Post-Incident Activity**    | Conduct lessons learned, create reports, and improve incident response plans.  |

## **How SOC Analysts Respond to Incidents:**
- Monitor logs and alerts (via SIEM)
- Investigate suspicious behavior
- Contain and isolate infected systems
- Coordinate with other teams
- Document and report the incident

## üß™ Lab Task: Detect and Respond: Windows Server RDP Brute Force Attack

---

## üß∞Lab Setup and Requirements

### üñ•Ô∏èMachines Required:
- **Windows Server 2019 or 2022**
  - RDP enabled
  - Event Viewer access
  - One local user account with known username
- **Kali Linux VM**
  - Hydra pre-installed
  - Connected to same LAN or Virtual Network

### üì∂Network:
- Ensure **both machines are on the same network**
- Verify **RDP (TCP/3389)** is open on Windows Server

---

## ‚öôÔ∏èPreparation Steps

### On **Windows Server**:
1. **Enable RDP**:  
   `System Properties ‚Üí Remote ‚Üí Enable Remote Desktop`

2. **Allow RDP in Firewall**:  
   `Windows Defender Firewall ‚Üí Advanced Settings ‚Üí Inbound Rules ‚Üí Remote Desktop (TCP-In) ‚Üí Enable`

3. **Create Test User**:
   ```powershell
   net user attackerlab Password123 /add
   ```
Open Event Viewer:
Windows Logs ‚Üí Security
Filter for Event ID 4625 (Failed Logon)



### üéØSimulate the Attack

1. On Kali Linux:
Install Hydra (if not installed):

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install hydra
```
Prepare Wordlist: Use the existing list or create a custom one, e.g.: /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
2. Run this command on Kali Linux:
```
hydra -t 4 -V -f -l attackerlab -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt rdp://<Windows_Server_IP>
```
Replace <Windows_Server_IP> with actual IP of Windows Server

### üëÅÔ∏èVisualize the Alert in Event Viewer
1. On Windows Server:
Open `Event Viewer ‚Üí Windows Logs ‚Üí Security`

2. Look for Event ID 4625 with:

Logon Type: 10 (RemoteInteractive / RDP)

Failure Reason: "Unknown user name or bad password"

Caller IP Address: IP of Kali machine



### üö®Incident Response Steps
1. Identify Repeated Failed Logons:
- Spot Event ID 4625 from same IP
2. Correlate IP Address:
- Confirm repeated failures from attacker‚Äôs IP
3. Lock the User Account (Optional):
```
net user attackerlab /active:no
```
4. Block Attacker IP:

```
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block Attacker" -Direction Inbound -RemoteAddress <Kali_IP> -Action Block
```
5. Collect Evidence:
- Export relevant Event Logs
6. Report Incident:
- Create a brief report with findings and actions taken

## üì©Submission Requirements
Submit the following:
- Screenshot of Hydra attack in Kali Linux
- Screenshot of Event Viewer showing multiple 4625 events
- Firewall rule

## ‚úÖConclusion
This lab demonstrated how to:
- Simulate an RDP brute-force attack using Hydra
- Detect suspicious logons via Windows Event Viewer
- Respond with basic IR steps without using Sysmon
