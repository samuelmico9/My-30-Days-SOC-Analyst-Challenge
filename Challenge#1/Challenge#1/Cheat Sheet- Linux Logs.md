## 🧠 Linux Logs Cheat Sheet

### 🔍 View Logs

```bash
cat /var/log/syslog              # Display entire log
less /var/log/auth.log           # Scroll through logs
tail -f /var/log/syslog          # Live log monitoring
journalctl                       # View systemd journal logs

### 📌 Filter Logs
```bash
grep "error" /var/log/syslog                     # Search for 'error'
journalctl -u ssh                                # Logs for SSH service
journalctl --since "1 hour ago"                  # Logs from the past hour
journalctl --since "2024-10-01" --until "2024-10-02"  # Logs between two dates
```


### 🛠️ Useful Log Management Commands
```bash
dmesg | less                        # View kernel ring buffer
logrotate -d /etc/logrotate.conf   # Test log rotation
last                               # Show login history
lastb                              # Show failed login attempts
```
###🧾 Example: Detect Failed SSH Logins
```bash
grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log
```
### 🔐 Why Are Logs Important?
- 🔍 Security Monitoring – Detect brute force attacks, unauthorized logins.
- 🛠️ Troubleshooting – Identify service errors and system crashes.
- 📜 Auditing – Track user activity and system changes.
