# Day#20- Splunk Basics: Investigating Unauthorized Access

---

## 🎯 Objective

To learn how to search and analyze authentication logs using Splunk to detect unauthorized access attempts, extract meaningful insights from fields like `user`, `src_ip`, and `status`, and identify suspicious login behaviors that may indicate compromise.

---

## 🛠️ Lab Setup

- **Ubuntu Server** (22.04 or later)  
- [Download Linux Auth log sample](https://github.com/0xrajneesh/90-Days-SOC-Challenge-Beginner/blob/main/Linux_UnAuthorized_Auditd_logs.json)

---

## Pre-requisite

- **[Setting up Splunk Server on Ubuntu Server] file will be provided** 

---

## Lab Task

📥 Submit the answers below along with screenshots from your Splunk queries.


- Question 1: What is the total number of success events in this log file?

- Question 2: What is the most common event triggered and captured in this log file?

- Question 3: If a user “jaimin_pathak” with a uid “1010” tried accessing a linux server. What the logfile path accessed by him twice?




## ✅ Conclusion

In this lab, you learned how to investigate unauthorized access attempts using Splunk by analyzing authentication logs. You gained hands-on experience with SPL (Search Processing Language) to query login data, detect suspicious activity, and extract valuable insights.  
This exercise helped you:

- Understand patterns of unauthorized access behavior.
- Use Splunk to identify high-risk user and IP combinations.
- Strengthen your skills in log analysis and incident investigation.
