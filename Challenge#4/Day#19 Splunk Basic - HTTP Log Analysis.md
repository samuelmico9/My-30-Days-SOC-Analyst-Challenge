# Day#19: Splunk Basics – HTTP Log Analysis

---

## 🎯 Objective

In this lab, you will:
- Learn how to ingest and analyze HTTP logs using Splunk.
- Detect client errors, server errors, and suspicious web activity.
- Identify large file transfers and suspicious URI access attempts.

---

## 🖥️ Lab Setup

- ✅ **Splunk**: Already installed and accessible.
- ✅ **Data Source**: JSON-formatted Zeek-style HTTP logs.
- 🌐 **Log File**: Download and upload to Splunk using the steps below.

📥 **[Download HTTP Log file] file will be provided **

---

## ⚙️ Steps to Upload HTTP Log into Splunk

1. Go to Splunk Web → **Settings > Add Data**.
2. Choose **Upload** and select `synthetic_zeek_http.json`.
3. Set Source type: `json` or create a new one `zeek:http`.
4. Index: Choose `main` or create a new index like `http_lab`.
5. Finish the upload and confirm indexing.

## 🔍 Lab Tasks

Use SPL queries to complete the following analysis:

### ✅ Task 1: Find the top 10 endpoints generating web traffic
```spl
index=http_lab sourcetype="json"
| stats count by "id.orig_h"
| sort -count
| head 10
```

### ✅Task 2: Count the number of server errors (5xx) observed
```spl
index=http_lab sourcetype="json" status_code>=500 status_code<600
| stats count as server_errors
```
### ✅Task 3: Identify User-Agents associated with possible scripted attacks
```spl
index=http_lab sourcetype="json" user_agent IN ("sqlmap/1.5.1", "curl/7.68.0", "python-requests/2.25.1", "botnet-checker/1.0")
| stats count by user_agent
```
### ✅Task 4: Find large file transfers (greater than 500 KB)
```spl
index=http_lab sourcetype="json" resp_body_len>500000
| table ts "id.orig_h" "id.resp_h" uri resp_body_len
| sort -resp_body_len
```
